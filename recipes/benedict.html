        <img src="../images/benedict.jpg" alt="eggs benedict">
        <p> Eggs Benedict requires a bit more effort than the sourdough waffle recipe, but if you have some time to spare in the morning this recipe is well worth
            the effort and becomes fairly easy after you've done it a few times.
        </p>
