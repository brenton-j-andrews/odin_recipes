        <p> A simple and delicious breakfast recipe from King Author Flour. The hardest part is maintaining a sourdough starter, <br> 
            but it really isn't too bad.This recipe can be used without any modifications for pancakes and waffles, though the waffles <br>
            are better! Serve warm with some maple syrup and whipped cream for a fairly easy yet fantastic breakfast. Recommend using <br>
            some of the leftover waffles as a sandwich bread, works great with cubano sandwiches anyway. Makes 12 6 inch waffles.
